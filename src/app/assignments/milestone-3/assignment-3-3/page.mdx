# Assignment 3.3: Design Meeting

<UnderDevelopment display={false} />

In Class: Tuesday, October 29; Thursday, October 31; Friday, November 1

This assignment is a component of <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.milestone_3_top}/>.
Be sure you have reviewed that larger context for this assignment.

The goal of this assignment is to share your design research,
explore multiple potential design ideas,
and consider a direction to pursue in the remainder of your project.

Each design meeting scheduling slot is 20 minutes.
Plan for 15 minutes of discussion, with transition time before and after your discussion.
Staff will have reviewed your submission prior to this discussion,
so you should plan for this to be a discussion of each design and your design direction.
If you have particular things you want to be sure to cover in discussion,
you should explicitly raise those as questions to the staff.

Groups are only expected to be present during their scheduled slot.
Groups may quietly use another portion of the room on the same day they are scheduled.
We ask that groups scheduled for another day meet elsewhere.

After your design meeting, capture your understanding of key feedback on each design.
Then also capture your understanding of feedback on design selection and direction for the remainder of your project.

## Meeting Sign Up

Sign Up Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment_3_2} />

Meetings will directly use the same Slides deck you prepared and submitted in Assignment 3.2.
You may continue to update those in-place in the Drive folder for course project files,
based on feedback or in preparing for discussion.

Within the Drive folder for course project files:

- Sign up for a design meeting scheduling slot.

The Drive folder for course project files is here:

<CourseDataLink linkKey={courseData.linkDriveProjectFiles} outerComponent="p"/>

## In Class

Be prepared to discuss your design research, tasks, and designs.

If a member of your group will need to join via video, arrange for that to work smoothly.

## Submission

Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment_3_3} />

Within the Drive folder for course project files:

- Identify the Slides deck corresponding to this assignment for your group.
  The deck provides a template for this assignment.
